<h2>Personal Information, Profile and Ideal Jobs</h2>

<h3>Francis Dharmasiri</h3>

<p>I am a Sri Lankan born Australian.
I migrated to Australia in 1990 and lived in Melbourne from then to 2010. now I
live in Bunbury, WA. I have 3 children and I am a proud grandpa of 6
grandchildren all of whom live in Melbourne.</p>

  <p>I started my work in Australia in the hospitality industry and eventually
  in year 2000 started a company in facilities management that I am managing to
  date.</p>

  <p>My hobbies are mainly reading, and my favourite topic is Philosophy, but I
  like keeping in touch with all the developments in the field of computing
  including software and hardware. I have been interested in the field from the
  time BASIC (Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) language came out
  in the 80’s. I am glad that now I have some time to pursue that interest in IT
  and do this degree in IT for my personal satisfaction and If possible to do
  some contract work in the field of systems security and penetration
  testing.</p>

<h3>Jordan Draganoff</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">Student Number: S3818714</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990’s and grew up in the large
country town of Bundaberg, Queensland. I enjoy an active lifestyle and love to
travel,  hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in 2013 and have been
working in my  parent’s business in the areas of sales, marketing and web
development to name a few.  In 2018, I decided to pursue my dream and started on
my journey to become an IT professional.</p>

<h4>Big 5 Personality Test</h4>

Test. [online] Available at: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/
[Accessed 10 Sep. 2019].</p>

<p>The results of the online tests outline that I’m a visual/tactile learner,
have high emotional stability and have a preference for thinking rather than
feeling. These results point out that while I do have good emotional stability,
I may struggle with understanding others emotions. The results such as my
preference for extraversion and agreeableness indicate that other team members
would be happy with my behaviour as part of a team. When forming a team, it
would be beneficial to find other members with a similar learning style of
visual/tactile as this would likely affect communications preferences and
sharing of useful resources throughout the group.</p>

<h3>Suki</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Sophie</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Chris</h3>

<p>My name is Chris Evans (RMIT Student number S3813726), I am 32 years old and live
  in Newcastle NSW. I have a beautiful wife (Caroline), a nine-month-old son (Austin)
   who keeps us very busy and a dog (Leo). My hobbies include sports such as baseball,
    golf and touch football. I also dabble in amateur home brewing, barbecuing, gardening, fishing and camping.
     I am currently trying to involve myself in any kind of climate change and renewable energy movements I can.
     I feel strongly about reducing the adverse effect we are having on the environment and have a personal goal
     to be involved in making a difference. My interest in IT began in high school in 2003 where I did my first
     computing studies. I then pursued a career involving IT as an Electronic Communications Tech in the Air Force
      for over 13 years I have progressed through the organisation from being a hands-on technician to a technical
      workforce manager. The further I progress in my career, the more managerial roles I undertake and the less
      technical knowledge I retain. I am studying IT to increase my knowledge and understanding of all things IT
      and in the process, limiting my skill fade. I am hoping to find a way to combine my interest of IT into my
      aspirations of environmental change. Whether that is through green energy technology advancements, sustainability
      with automation or networking household energy storage; only the future will tell. </p>

<p>My test results:
Myers-Briggs result – Protagonist ENFJ-T
Learning Style – Visual 45%
Creativity – Ability to carry large quantities of information and manage effectively, desire to change the accepted
norm and to push for continual improvement.
</p>

<p>How this will help the group: The results of my tests indicate that I need to be open and accepting of team
  feedback and take this on board for future interactions. I also should start as soon as I can when making big
  decisions as I can lose confidence if time gets away from me. I digest things better if they are visually intuitive
   and I like logical information structure to ensure I can comprehend our progress.</P>

<h3>Graphic Technologies</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">

  Graphic Technologies By Francis Dharmasiri<br>

<p>Graphic technology is a huge industry and one of the largest in the world.
   Over the past decade we have seen this industry grow exponentially in the
   areas of Software as well as hardware giving us the capability to create
   realistic visual imagery be it in the form of cinema, gaming, virtual reality
   augmented reality and the ongoing research into holography.The biggest contributing
   factor in its current development is due to the unprecedented development in graphic
   processors and random-access memory. When we take these into consideration it is hard
   not to acknowledge two companies that have contributed largely to its momentum in
   growth and those companies are NVidia and AMD graphics. Due to their ferocious
   competitiveness with each other we have been able to enjoy some of the best technologies
   base on hardware, however hardware alone will not contribute to the visual graphic
    capabilities that we currently possess.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that the strides we have made in the are of Graphical software
   is mainly due to the popularity of games as well as the scientific
  research and development that demands innovation and new capabilities.</p>

  <p>Gaming Software</P><br>
  <p>Unreal Game engine by epic games<br></p>

<p>If you want to develop an epic game you might probably want to use this game engine,
  considered one of the best game engines in the word and created using C++ programming
  language It has all the necessary features built into it.  A 3D game engine with Terrain,
  Physics and all other features that you need to create graphics that mimic reality.
  This game engine may not be suitable for small games as it also needs high end hardware
  like Nvidia GeForce RTX2080 Turing with ray tracing to get   the optimal capabilities
  of the game engine. An excellent example what current high-end software and hardware can do.<br>

  Platforms: Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox and more<br>
  games created: Marvel Heroes, Batman: Arkham Origins, Infinity Blade 3, WWE Immortals and more.<br>

  Some of the other software for gaming include but not limited to Unity based on programming
  language C#, Godot written in C, C++ and C# with GDNative bindings such as Rust, D , Nim or
  using it’s own scripting language GD Scripts a high level , dynamically typed programming
  language like Python.<p>

<p>But we also need to have a look at other very essential software that is used in the graphic
   creation space like Autodesk Maya, Photoshop, 3DS Max to mention a few these software’s normally
   used for creation of commercial products in specific areas including Movies like Nemo and other
   popular graphic based characters that we see in movies like Transformers just to mention a few.
</P>

<p>Medical Imaging.</P>

<p>Graphic technology is not limited to entertainment as I mentioned previously, the industry’s
   growth was influenced by our need to innovate graphical capabilities for more essential needs
   like in the area of Health. This imaging technology is mainly based on Computed Tomography,
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography and Phase-Contrast and Proton CT to name a few.</p>

<p>The latest software and hardware developments in this field is also spear headed by Nvidia.
   Recently they have developed a platform of hardware and software incorporating artificial intelligence known
   as Nvidia Clara Platform. This software kit will give the developers to apply a wide range of AI powered
   applications to existing medical imaging equipment that I mentioned above.   </P>

<p>Nvidia is not the only company that is making innovation’s in this area of medical Imaging.
   For example, Deep learning start-up Aidoc has created a software platform that can use AI to analyse
   Computed Tomography (CT Scan) for comprehensive full body Technology. </p>

<p>Also, the Deep learning company Subtle medical who is a member of Nvidia’s Inception virtual
   accelerator program is aiming to create a MRI machine that acquires images in quarter of the
   time while requiring just 10% of the contrast dosage to patients.  </P>

<p>In conclusion I must mention that I have not even touched on the subject of Hardware and other
  aspects that cover the area of Graphic Technologies that span the whole IT industry and incorporates
  every aspect of it, a comprehensive look at the industry may fall under writing a book about it
  and may not be within the scope of a article.</p>
