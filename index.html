<h2>Personal Information, Profile and Ideal Jobs</h2>

<h3>Francis Dharmasiri</h3>

<p>I am a Sri Lankan born Australian.
I migrated to Australia in 1990 and lived in Melbourne from then to 2010. now I
live in Bunbury, WA. I have 3 children and I am a proud grandpa of 6
grandchildren all of whom live in Melbourne.</p>

  <p>I started my work in Australia in the hospitality industry and eventually
  in year 2000 started a company in facilities management that I am managing to
  date.</p>

  <p>My hobbies are mainly reading, and my favourite topic is Philosophy, but I
  like keeping in touch with all the developments in the field of computing
  including software and hardware. I have been interested in the field from the
  time BASIC (Beginners All Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) language came out
  in the 80’s. I am glad that now I have some time to pursue that interest in IT
  and do this degree in IT for my personal satisfaction and If possible to do
  some contract work in the field of systems security and penetration
  testing.</p>

  <h4>Myers-Brigs Style Test</h4>
  <p style="text-align:center">My Type INFP</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">Introvert(19%)</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">iNtuitive(88%)</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">Feeling(25%)</p>
  <p style="text-align:center">Perceiving(12%)</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">
   You have moderate preference of Introversion over Extraversion (19%)<br>
   You have strong preference of Intuition over Sensing (88%)<br>
   You have moderate preference of Feeling over Thinking (25%)<br>
   You have slight preference of Perceiving over Judging (12%)<p>

 <p>INFPs never seem to lose their sense of wonder. One might say they see life
 through rose-colored glasses. It's as though they live at the edge of a
 looking-glass world where mundane objects come to life, where flora and
 fauna take on near-human qualities.  <p>

  <p>INFPs are not exempt from the same disappointments and frustrations common
    to humanity. As INTPs tend to have a sense of failed competence, INFPs struggle
    with the issue of their own ethical perfection, e.g., performance of duty for
    the greater cause. An INFP friend describes the inner conflict as not good
    versus bad, but on a grand scale, Good vs. Evil. Luke Skywalker in Star Wars
    depicts this conflict in his struggle between the two sides of "The Force."
    Although the dark side must be reckoned with, the INFP believes that good
    ultimately triumphs.<p>
    <p>Some INFPs have a gift for taking technical information and putting it into
    layman's terms. Brendan Kehoe's Zen and the Art of the Internet is one example
    of this "de-jargoning" talent in action.<p/>
    <p>(INFP stands for Introvert, iNtuitive, Feeling, Perceiving and represents
    individual's preferences in four dimensions characterising personality type,
    according to Jung's and Briggs Myers' theories of personality type.)<p>

    <p> What my test's reveile? The results of the online test will reveal to
        the group about my personality it's strong points and week points thus helping
        them to know me better to interact and work with me better. I think
        these tests are a good general purpose indicator for employers and others
        to know why a person is the way they are. </P>

<h3>Jordan Draganoff</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">Student Number: S3818714</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990’s and grew up in the large
country town of Bundaberg, Queensland. I enjoy an active lifestyle and love to
travel,  hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in 2013 and have been
working in my  parent’s business in the areas of sales, marketing and web
development to name a few.  In 2018, I decided to pursue my dream and started on
my journey to become an IT professional.</p>

<p>The results of the online tests outline that I’m a visual/tactile learner,
have high emotional stability and have a preference for thinking rather than
feeling. These results point out that while I do have good emotional stability,
I may struggle with understanding others emotions. The results such as my
preference for extraversion and agreeableness indicate that other team members
would be happy with my behaviour as part of a team. When forming a team, it
would be beneficial to find other members with a similar learning style of
visual/tactile as this would likely affect communications preferences and
sharing of useful resources throughout the group.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Suki</h3>

<p> My name is Susika ‘Suki’ Sumanasuriya, student number: S3620271.
 I was born in Sri lanka but migrated to Australia when I was 12, I am bilingual
 and can speak 2 languages (english & sinhala), my favorite pastime includes
 watching tv shows & movies. My interest in IT has been a lifelong obsession,
 ever since I was a kid, I always had a particular interest in technology over
 other things. I currently have no actual experience in IT apart from the IT
 electives i took during my grade school years. I am very happy to be part of
 the SWELD group, and hope to do the very best.</P>

 <p style="text-align:center">
    Test results</br>

    <h4>Myers-Briggs test</h4></br></P>
    <p style="text-align:center">
      Personality type: "The Advocate" (INFJ-T) Individual traits: Introverted - 81 %<br>
     Intuitive - 91 %<br>
     Feeling - 56%<br>
     Judging - 64%<br>
     Turbulent - 75%<br>
     Role: Diplomat <br>

 <p style="text-align:center">
    Learning style test <br>
• 	Auditory: 40%
• 	Visual: 30%
• 	Tactile: 30% <br><br>
<p>If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard.
You store information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones.
You often learn by reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.<br><br>
As an auditory learner, you probably hum br talk lo yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying
attention. even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.<br><br>
Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.<br><br>
 	Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.<br>
  Use flashcards to team new words: read them out loud.<br>
	Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.<br>
  Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.<br>
 	Have test questions read to you out loud.<br>
 	Study new material by reading It out loud.
  Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.<br><br>
  These tests have shown what my true personality is, it’s something I have never directly<br>
  contemplated about but i think these personality tests will prove useful when I am working in<br>
  a team environment, for example the career test prove that my need for leadership is low but<br>
  my need for organization is high so my role in a team could include helping to organize the<br>
  necessary objectives in regards to solving a problem.<br><br>

  Ideal job<br><br>
  My ideal job would be to someday be a Research Scientist specialising in Machine Learning like<br>
  the advertisement posted at seek.com.au (Link and Spashot is below). The position is meant to<br>
  help device novel techniques powered by Machine Learning algorithms to explore minerals and <br>
  metals in a much more sustainable way. This role requires the researcher to have at least 4 years<br>
  of experience in researching novel machine learning algorithms, preferably a Masters in Computer<br>
  Science and expert level proficiency in a variety of programming languages. Inorder for me to<br>
  qualify for this job I would have to finish two courses I am currently studying (IPT and ITT),<br>
  and then finish the Bachelors in Information Technology, afterwards find a junior research job <br>
  and get a Masters in Computer Science as i am doing my job and then hopefully in a half decade<br>
  I would qualify for this job.</P><p>

<h3>Chris Evans</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">Student Number: S3813726</p>

<p>My name is Chris Evans (RMIT Student number S3813726), I am 32 years old and live
  in Newcastle NSW. I have a beautiful wife (Caroline), a nine-month-old son (Austin)
   who keeps us very busy and a dog (Leo). My hobbies include sports such as baseball,
    golf and touch football. I also dabble in amateur home brewing, barbecuing, gardening, fishing and camping.
     I am currently trying to involve myself in any kind of climate change and renewable energy movements I can.
     I feel strongly about reducing the adverse effect we are having on the environment and have a personal goal
     to be involved in making a difference. My interest in IT began in high school in 2003 where I did my first
     computing studies. I then pursued a career involving IT as an Electronic Communications Tech in the Air Force
      for over 13 years I have progressed through the organisation from being a hands-on technician to a technical
      workforce manager. The further I progress in my career, the more managerial roles I undertake and the less
      technical knowledge I retain. I am studying IT to increase my knowledge and understanding of all things IT
      and in the process, limiting my skill fade. I am hoping to find a way to combine my interest of IT into my
      aspirations of environmental change. Whether that is through green energy technology advancements, sustainability
      with automation or networking household energy storage; only the future will tell. </p>

<h4>My test results</h4>

      <p style="text-align:center">Myers-Briggs result – Protagonist ENFJ-T</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">Learning Style – Visual 45%</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">Creativity – Ability to carry large quantities of information and manage effectively, desire to change the accepted
      norm and to push for continual improvement.</p>

<h4>How this will help the group?</h4>

<p>The results of my tests indicate that I need to be open and accepting of team
  feedback and take this on board for future interactions. I also should start as soon as I can when making big
  decisions as I can lose confidence if time gets away from me. I digest things better if they are visually intuitive
   and I like logical information structure to ensure I can comprehend our progress.</P>

<h2>IT Work</h2>

<h2>IT Technologies</h2>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p style="text-align:center">

  Graphic Technologies By Francis Dharmasiri<br>

<p>Graphic technology is a huge industry and one of the largest in the world.
   Over the past decade we have seen this industry grow exponentially in the
   areas of Software as well as hardware giving us the capability to create
   realistic visual imagery be it in the form of cinema, gaming, virtual reality
   augmented reality and the ongoing research into holography.The biggest contributing
   factor in its current development is due to the unprecedented development in graphic
   processors and random-access memory. When we take these into consideration it is hard
   not to acknowledge two companies that have contributed largely to its momentum in
   growth and those companies are NVidia and AMD graphics. Due to their ferocious
   competitiveness with each other we have been able to enjoy some of the best technologies
   base on hardware, however hardware alone will not contribute to the visual graphic
    capabilities that we currently possess.</p>

<p>It is fair to say that the strides we have made in the are of Graphical software
   is mainly due to the popularity of games as well as the scientific
  research and development that demands innovation and new capabilities.</p>

  <p>Gaming Software</P><br>
  <p>Unreal Game engine by epic games<br></p>

<p>If you want to develop an epic game you might probably want to use this game engine,
  considered one of the best game engines in the word and created using C++ programming
  language It has all the necessary features built into it.  A 3D game engine with Terrain,
  Physics and all other features that you need to create graphics that mimic reality.
  This game engine may not be suitable for small games as it also needs high end hardware
  like Nvidia GeForce RTX2080 Turing with ray tracing to get   the optimal capabilities
  of the game engine. An excellent example what current high-end software and hardware can do.<br>

  Platforms: Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox and more<br>
  games created: Marvel Heroes, Batman: Arkham Origins, Infinity Blade 3, WWE Immortals and more.<br>

  Some of the other software for gaming include but not limited to Unity based on programming
  language C#, Godot written in C, C++ and C# with GDNative bindings such as Rust, D , Nim or
  using it’s own scripting language GD Scripts a high level , dynamically typed programming
  language like Python.<p>

<p>But we also need to have a look at other very essential software that is used in the graphic
   creation space like Autodesk Maya, Photoshop, 3DS Max to mention a few these software’s normally
   used for creation of commercial products in specific areas including Movies like Nemo and other
   popular graphic based characters that we see in movies like Transformers just to mention a few.
</P>

<p>Medical Imaging.</P>

<p>Graphic technology is not limited to entertainment as I mentioned previously, the industry’s
   growth was influenced by our need to innovate graphical capabilities for more essential needs
   like in the area of Health. This imaging technology is mainly based on Computed Tomography,
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography and Phase-Contrast and Proton CT to name a few.</p>

<p>The latest software and hardware developments in this field is also spear headed by Nvidia.
   Recently they have developed a platform of hardware and software incorporating artificial intelligence known
   as Nvidia Clara Platform. This software kit will give the developers to apply a wide range of AI powered
   applications to existing medical imaging equipment that I mentioned above.   </P>

<p>Nvidia is not the only company that is making innovation’s in this area of medical Imaging.
   For example, Deep learning start-up Aidoc has created a software platform that can use AI to analyse
   Computed Tomography (CT Scan) for comprehensive full body Technology. </p>

<p>Also, the Deep learning company Subtle medical who is a member of Nvidia’s Inception virtual
   accelerator program is aiming to create a MRI machine that acquires images in quarter of the
   time while requiring just 10% of the contrast dosage to patients.  </P>

<p>In conclusion I must mention that I have not even touched on the subject of Hardware and other
  aspects that cover the area of Graphic Technologies that span the whole IT industry and incorporates
  every aspect of it, a comprehensive look at the industry may fall under writing a book about it
  and may not be within the scope of a article.</p>
