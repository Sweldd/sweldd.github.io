outline that I&rsquo;m a visual/tactile learner, have high emotional stability
and have a preference for thinking rather than feeling. These results point out
that while I do have good emotional stability, I may struggle with understanding
others emotions. The results such as my preference for extraversion and
agreeableness indicate that other team members would be happy with my behaviour
as part of a team. When forming a team, it would be beneficial to find other
members with a similar learning style of visual/tactile as this would likely
affect communications preferences and sharing of useful resources throughout the
group.</span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c23 c29">Ideal Job</span></p><p

class="c26"><span class="c2">This job is calling for a business analyst to help
a commercial wholesaler replatform their current ecommerce system to the newest
version of Magento. This position appeals to me as I currently have experience
in website development and am somewhat familiar with Magento. This job pays up
to $150,000 for it&rsquo;s 12 month contract. This type of work appeals to me as
I love to travel; this kind of high paying short contract work will allow me to
travel more.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">This job is calling for a
person with great business and management skills/experience. It also favours
someone with experience in B2B ecommerce and Majento. For me to pursue a job
such as this one, I would first have to gain more experience in a business
analyst position. It would also be greatly beneficial for me to learn and get
more comfortable with the Magento ecommerce platform.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">I will first need to gain some experience working
as a business analyst. The job position of Junior Business Analyst would be a
great to gain experience as often the junior position doesn&rsquo;t require
nearly as much experience. Once I have gained enough work experience in lower
position, I would have a much higher chance of securing a contract for a high
paying business analyst position. It would also be greatly beneficial for me to
become more familiar with common software used in the B2B selling
environment.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c39

marginal or no (1%) preference of Judging over Perceiving, characteristics of
more than one personality type may apply to you: INFJ and INFP.</span></p><p
class="c43"><span class="c6">You have moderate preference of Introversion over
Extraversion (50%)</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c6">You have strong
preference of Intuition over Sensing (88%)</span></p><p class="c43"><span
class="c6">You have moderate preference of Feeling over Thinking
(25%)</span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c6">You have a slight preference of
Perceiving over Judging (1%)</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c6">INFJs are
distinguished by both their complexity of character and the unusual range and
depth of their talents. Strongly humanitarian in outlook, INFJs tend to be
idealists, and because of their J preference for closure and completion, they
are generally &quot;doers&quot; as well as dreamers. This rare combination of
vision and practicality often results in INFJs taking a disproportionate amount
of responsibility in the various causes to which so many of them seem to be
drawn.</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c6">INFJs are deeply concerned
about their relations with individuals as well as the state of humanity at
large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear
so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people -- a product of the
Feeling function they most readily show to the world. On the contrary, INFJs are
true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a
chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious &quot;soul
mates.&quot; While instinctively courting the personal and organizational
demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals INFJs will suddenly
withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates. This
apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to
rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload
to which they are so susceptible as inherent &quot;givers.&quot; As a pattern of
behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ
character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood -- particularly
by those who have little experience with this rare type.</span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">(INFJ stands for Introvert, iNtuitive, Feeling,
Judging and represents an individual&#39;s preferences in four dimensions
characterising personality type, according to Jung&#39;s and Briggs Myers&#39;
theories of personality type.)</span></p><p class="c21 c25"><span

c9">INFJ Learning Style</span></h4><p class="c21"><span class="c6">An
INFJ&rsquo;s interest in learning a subject is related to the question,
&ldquo;Is it good for people?&rdquo; The more they see a topic to be beneficial
to others, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire
to actively engage in it. Their interest in studying the material is motivated
by their desire to find solutions to people-related issues.</span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">INFJs easily take in information when a significant
part of it is devoted to the topic&rsquo;s relevance and connection to people.
They also learn easily if the knowledge they receive significantly expands the
boundaries of their understanding and opportunities for application in the given
area, and appeals to their feelings or moral values. They are able to quite
easily comprehend material even when it consists of information that lacks
significant logical flow. For example, learning the rules of the road may be no
more difficult for an INFJ than grasping a theory. They are capable of
independently learning and understanding new material.</span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">INFJs are capable of mechanical memorization, but
the amount retained this way is less than from memory based on understanding.
INFJs are capable of accurately reproducing received information, especially if
they associate it with any feelings.</span></p><p class="c21"><span
class="c6">INFJs are able to actively apply acquired knowledge and skills to
their work. They can apply them in concrete assignments or further develop them
in a given direction. Working with material they have learned, understood, and
internalized brings them great enjoyment.</span></p><p class="c21"><span
class="c6">INFJs have a high level of tolerance to high levels of learning
related stress, but they prefer to evenly distribute their efforts when learning
new material and avoid last-minute cramming.</span></p><p class="c21 c25"><span
class="c6"></span></p><h4 class="c66" id="h.l45hb27yypau"><span class="c34 c9

class="c6">Material is delivered on a theoretical basis, especially as it
relates to the humanities and social sciences</span></p><p class="c21"><span
class="c6">They work independently with the study material</span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">They participate in group work with the material
(can be a good supplement to independent work)</span></p><p class="c21"><span
class="c6">The same material is repeatedly presented (improves
retention)</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c6">Material is delivered from
different viewpoints and using varied examples (improves retention)</span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">Material is complex (often increases their drive to
learn it)</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c6">Learning is systematic
(e.g., an organized degree or certification program)</span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">Visual aids and active learning methods are
used</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c6">Material is delivered at a

baseball, golf and touch football. I also dabble in amateur home brewing,

myself in any kind of climate change and renewable energy movements I can. I
feel strongly about reducing the adverse effect we are having on the environment
and have a personal goal to be involved in making a difference. My interest in
IT began in high school in 2003 where I did my first computing studies. I then
pursued a career involving IT as an Electronic Communications Tech in the Air
Force where for over 13 years I have progressed through the organisation from
being a hands-on technician to a technical workforce manager. The further I
progress in my career, the more managerial roles I undertake and the less
technical knowledge I retain. I am studying IT to increase my knowledge and
understanding of all things IT and in the process, limiting my skill fade. I am
hoping to find a way to combine my interest of IT into my aspirations of
environmental change. Whether that is through green energy technology

&nbsp;Cybersecurity</span></p><p class="c26"><span
class="c2">&nbsp;Francis</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">In
today&rsquo;s connected digital world cybersecurity is one aspect that cannot be
ignored and is one of the most important areas of technology that the connected
world cannot live without.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">What does
it do?</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">Cybersecurity is the means of
protecting computer systems, networks and programs from unauthorised access,
changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users or
interrupting normal business process. &nbsp;Cybersecurity is critical for
business organisations and governments that need to run critical applications
24/7 without downtime or interruptions to its services. This day and age
implementing effective security measures are becoming increasingly difficult
because of the number of devices that are deployed are more than the human
population and the attackers are becoming more and more innovative. For a
cybersecurity system to work there are a lot of factors that must come to gather
and work to gather. A normal cybersecurity system has many layers of protection
in place in the form of software, networking, inscription data access
restrictions and data structure and data base fragmentation with different
access controls to mention a few. But it is also the responsibility of the users
to comply with the basic data security principles by adhering to practises like
using strong passwords and securing the passwords not giving pass words to any
one, not even to your closet family or friends and being aware of email
attachments and other unsolicited messages that can carry hidden software like
viruses and trojans . What ever we may do we must always be aware that there is
always a chance of our systems getting hacked and this must be in the forefront
of every employee and user that is a part of a critical service provider and
know that each person carries the responsibility of security of the information
that is available to them , being unaware of this responsibility may cause you
to face legal action and loss of job and in some cases even jail time. So, what
does this all mean? all these critical actions and responsibilities and the
software and the hardware in conjunction creates a part of the cybersecurity
layers that are in place to protect systems from attacks.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">The responsibility of systems security and
monitoring and implementing these mentioned regulations in a company or any
organisation falls on the Systems administrator and Systems security analyst ,
it is the expertise , knowledge and capabilities of these individuals that will
ensure &nbsp;that these systems are in place and all staff are trained and
briefed on there responsibilities and are advised what to do and what not to do
in any given situation . It is also there responsibility to make sure that all
the software that runs on a system is &nbsp;patched and scanned for any
backdoors or any other vulnerability and implement 24 / 7 monitoring systems
using software as well as the security of the server rooms and other
infrastructure that belongs to the computer network. Their responsibility does
not end there as the individuals responsible for probably the most valuable
asset of a company being the data that is stored in these servers they must
monitor all traffic that comes in and out of these servers and implement
necessary measures to know who is accessing what and if any anomaly is detected
to have the system raise alarms and have systems that can isolate the affected
areas whiles making sure that the day to day flow of data or business is not
interrupted. The have a lot of tools of the trade that they use to achieve these
task like port scanners, firewalls , firewall rules, hardware firewalls and air
gapping critical information servers. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p
class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span
class="c2">Platforms: Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox and more
games created: Marvel Heroes, Batman: Arkham Origins, Infinity Blade 3, WWE
Immortals and more.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Some of the other
software for gaming include but are not limited to Unity based on programming
language C#, Godot written in C, C++ and C# with GDNative bindings such as Rust,
D , Nim or using it&rsquo;s own scripting language GD Scripts a high level ,
dynamically typed programming language like Python.</span></p><p class="c3
c35"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">But we also
need to have a look at other very essential software that is used in the graphic
creation space like Autodesk Maya, Photoshop, 3DS Max to mention a few of these
software&rsquo;s normally used for creation of commercial products in specific
areas including Movies like Nemo and other popular graphic based characters that
we see in movies like Transformers just to mention a few.</span></p><p class="c3
c35"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Medical
Imaging.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Graphic technology is not
limited to entertainment as I mentioned previously, the industry&rsquo;s growth
was influenced by our need to innovate graphical capabilities for more essential
needs like in the area of Health. This imaging technology is mainly based on
Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography
and Phase-Contrast and Proton CT to name a few. The latest software and hardware
developments in this field is also spearheaded by Nvidia. Recently they have
developed a platform of hardware and software incorporating artificial
intelligence known as Nvidia Clara Platform. This software kit will give the
developers to apply a wide range of AI powered applications to existing medical
imaging equipment that I mentioned above.</span></p><p class="c16"><span
class="c2">Nvidia is not the only company that is making innovation in this area
of medical Imaging. For example, Deep learning start-up Aidoc has created a
software platform that can use AI to analyse Computed Tomography (CT Scan) for
comprehensive full body Technology.</span></p><p class="c16"><span
class="c2">Also, the Deep learning company Subtle medical who is a member of
Nvidia&rsquo;s Inception virtual accelerator program is aiming to create an MRI
machine that acquires images in a quarter of the time while requiring just 10%
of the contrast dosage to patients.</span></p><p class="c3 c35"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">In conclusion, I must
mention that I have not even touched on the subject of Hardware and other
aspects that cover the area of Graphic Technologies that span the whole IT
industry and incorporates every aspect of it, a comprehensive look at the
industry may fall under writing a book about it and may not be within the scope

class="c32 c73 subtitle" id="h.42nvy9bomag"><span class="c20 c9">What is the
state of the art of this new technology? </span></p><p class="c8"><span
class="c9">Machine learning enables machines to acquire new skills by analysing
copious amounts of data and looking for patterns within those data, this
essentially makes them better at a task simply through trial and error. This is
made possible by giving a machine </span><span class="c9 c74">training and
testing sets</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(data) of the very thing we would want
a machine to be better at, an example could include facial recognition; through
machine learning a machine can learn from the two sets, one set (the training
set) to sift through to look for patterns within the data, in this case the data
could be faces of random individuals and another set (the testing set) could
include an extra set of people completely separate and unique from the training
set to verify those new found patterns, if for some reason the verification
comes to a halt, the machine learning algorithm makes an automatic adjustment to
its own algorithm and tries again till it gets better over time through trial
and error and eventually if the algorithm is upto the task, after the initial
training period the machine should be able to recognize different faces.

class="c9 c45">What can be done now? </span></p><p class="c8"><span
class="c6">Currently one of the uses of machine learning algorithms includes the
enhancement of the customer experience for example some enterprises use machine
learning powered chat-bots that has been trained on different so called chat-bot
datasets to provide its customers efficient and quick self - service without the
need for staff based service, and as the technology matures it is said that more
businesses both large and small will adopt this technology for the benefits of
efficiency and cost saving. </span></p><p class="c8 c25"><span class="c9
c12"></span></p><p class="c61 c32 subtitle" id="h.gci5aam3l782"><span class="c45
c9">What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?
&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">According to some computer
scientists, machine learning algorithms would soon be able to generalize its
abilities in detecting patterns as the current methods requires an enormous
amount of data to excel at specific singular tasks (i.e. chatbots), if an
algorithm can generalize its learned abilities from one data set to another (
i.e. reading) it will be a more efficient use of resources and ability. Also
current learning algorithms are prone to so called adversarial attacks where
simulated signals implanted within the data set can trick the algorithm and
could cause it to malfunction, it is hoped that solutions for these types of
attacks will be designed within the next couple of years. </span></p><p
class="c8 c25"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9
c65">What technological or other developments make this possible? </span></p><p
class="c8 c25"><span class="c12 c9"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9
c50">On a technical level, more processing power in the near future should aid
machine learning algorithms to generalize its abilities, as well as advances in
data storage and management, this will aid in further understanding of the depth
of current data-sets and this will enable researchers to extrapolate relations
between different tasks so they can design much more proficient and
generalizable algorithms. As for adversarial attacks better more robust
algorithms will have to be implemented, it is said that by embedding human
biases into these algorithms it could help machine learning algorithms to
identify these signals and purge them out of the data-set before any malfunction
occurs, although for the time being this method is unproven for the most part.
&nbsp;</span></p><h1 class="c57 c32" id="h.44sp5ch213po"><span class="c48
c9">What is the likely impact? </span></h1><p class="c61 c32 subtitle"
id="h.dv0y2tdgdhsv"><span class="c6">Advanced machine learning algorithms could
have profound impacts on the job market as algorithms begin to replace human
workers, for example in the United States, the increase in automation over
manual labour is on pace to take close to 35% of jobs within the next couple of
decades, also according to some economists the economic benefit gained by
implementing these new and novel technologies will only benefit the rich as the
monetary benefit in cost saving and efficiency won&rsquo;t necessarily trickle
down. While the majority of the workforce will still be employed in 20 years,
the creation of new jobs will slowly stagnate noticeably as attrition gradually
leads to fewer people in the workplace, this could in turn make economic
inequality worse and further divide the gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a report published by ONS (Office of National Statistics) of
England, 3 most at risk jobs are waiters, shelf fillers and elementary sales
occupations.</span></p><h1 class="c32 c57" id="h.rtmtsfids5n7"><span class="c48
c9">How will this affect me? </span></h1><p class="c8"><span class="c6">As
according to what is mentioned above, this technology will displace many people
in the workforce in turn possibly disrupting the financial and or economic
livelihood of many people. According to some researchers machine enabled job
loss could have profound socio economic issues that is hard to predict, and some
tech leaders such as elon musk has gone far as to recommend a Universal Basic
Income or UBI to guarantee these displaced people a livable wage. It is yet to
be seen how these advanced algorithms will affect the economy. </span></p><p

class="c68"><span class="c37">Robots are machines capable of completing complex
series of actions automatically. They can be guided by external programming or
the programming can be embedded within and can be used autonomously or
semi-autonomously, ranging from humanoids through to medical operating robots,
therapy robots and also for the military. With the different uses for robots,
the continual developments being made in robotics vary greatly, such as the TOSY
Ping Pong Playing Robot, the advances in military equipment like Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle drones and the emerging nanorobotics. With various methods such as,
evolutionary robotics, where a number of different robots are submitted to
testing and those with the best performance are submitted as a model to create
subsequent &ldquo;generations&rdquo;, as well as developmental robotics, which
involves the tracking of changes and developments within a single robot in the
areas of problem-solving and other functions. According to a Forrester report,
&lsquo;robots will eliminate 6 percent of all jobs in the United States by 2021.
McKinsey&rsquo;s assessment on the matter is more extensive, with them believing
that by 2030 one third of American jobs could be more automated. According to a
new report in 2019 by Oxford Economics, &ldquo;How Robots Change the
World&rdquo;, up to 20 million manufacturing jobs could be lost to robots by
2030, in line with the assessments made by McKinsey. The report suggests that in
Australia, South Australia is most vulnerable to the future robot
rollout.</span></p><p class="c68"><span class="c37">&nbsp;</span></p><p
class="c68"><span class="c60">Although there are a significant changes in
society that robots will influence in the future, there will also be new careers
and fields of technology that will evolve as a result. With the advancements in
medical and rehabilitation robots, researchers at Carnegie Mellon were able to
experiment with millimetre sized robots to perform heart surgery, and engineers
at Autodesk were also able to help medical researchers to develop nano-robots
that could be injected into cancer patients to kill cancer cells.</span></p><h3

and Arduino UNO Device. Source: Self</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Small computing devices
such as the Raspberry Pi, Arduino and Makey Makey are challenging what many
people think a computer is and should be used for. This report will cover these
three small computing devices and discuss what they are, what is their impact
and how they affect me and the people around me.</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Just a few years ago if
someone told you that you could buy a computer mother board complete with CPU,
Memory and networking for just US$35 (Raspberry Pi Foundation, 2019) they would
walk away laughing. If you then told them that this cheap computer could support
two 4k displays, or over 16 million pixels, there&rsquo;s no way they would take
you seriously. But the aforementioned device is commercially available today
from Raspberry Pi. The smallest Raspberry Pi device actually starts from US$5
and with the addition of an SD card for storage, operating system, keyboard,
mouse and display it is a fully functioning computer system. The Raspberry
Pi&rsquo;s CPU is based on the ARM architecture which is a common architecture
used for smartphone CPU&rsquo;s. ARM based CPUs are known for being more compact
and energy efficient than their x86 counterparts (Android Authority, 2014). A
Raspberry Pi device will typically be loaded with a GNU/Linux based operating
system such as Raspbian. The Raspbian operating system comes with education and
programming software such as Python and Java (Raspberry Pi Foundation, 2019). As
Raspberry Pi boards are the size of a credit card or smaller, they can and are
often used to power other devices ranging from VPN routers and compact web
servers to miniature weather stations and drones. The Raspberry Pi isn&rsquo;t
the only kid on the block when it comes to small computing devices to power the
world&#39;s latest technology and gadgets though.</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">Arduino is an electronics
platform circuit board that comes in multiple shapes and sizes much like the
Raspberry Pi. The Arduino is different as it cannot support an operating system
like the Raspberry Pi can, instead it uses a microcontroller that is programmed
by a connected computer. Arduino programming is based on the C++ programming
language but is simplified by the Arduino Programming Language and the Arduino
Software package (Arduino, 2019). Arduino boards can be used to power a huge
number of projects including automatic lighting, fingerprint readers and basic
robots (Ubuntu Pit, 2019). Arduinos are great for projects that do not require
the full processing power of a computer to perform lots of complex tasks at the
same time. For people with less technology knowledge or experience that
wouldn&rsquo;t be comfortable setting up a Raspberry Pi or Arduino, but still
want to get involved in the small computing craze, there is another device
called the Makey Makey which allows you to turn basically any object into an
input source for your computer.</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">The Makey Makey
doesn&rsquo;t really fit into the category of small computing devices as it
doesn&rsquo;t really do any computing. It is a device designed by two students
at the MIT Media Lab (Makey Makey, 2019). Makey Makey is a small circuit board
sold with a set of alligator clips and probes. The clips and probes are used to
connect the circuit board to everyday objects, such as bananas or play-doh. The
device connects to a computer via USB cable and is an input source, kind of like
a keyboard. If the connected objects are at least slightly conductive, and a
circuit is made through it, it will register a key press on the computer. The
Makey Makey device was designed to be simple, as a way to introduce people to
the basics of electronics and circuits, rather than be a standalone computing
device like the Raspberry Pi or Arduino.</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">The introduction of small
computing devices, namely Raspberry Pi and Arduino, have been widely adopted by
technology enthusiasts and professionals alike and really questions how big a
computer should be and how much it should cost. A great example of how small
computing devices have been widely adopted is the increased use of Chromebook
laptops in schools. These are used as an example as Chromebooks share similar
properties to Raspberry Pis as they are a low cost, low power alternative to
another product. In the United States there has been a massive shift from
traditional laptops running Apple or Microsoft software to devices running
Google software (New York Times, 2017). I feel that this shift will affect other
parts of the computing world such as data servers and home computers as people
and companies alike will discover the lower cost, and arguably better,
alternatives. Devices like Arduino have also been successful by providing people
an affordable entry into the electronics and programming circles. The popularity
of Arduino can been seen all over the internet with people creating videos and
writing about their projects. This has been a great advancement as the
electronics market shows huge potential for the future and I believe it will be
more and more important that people have an understanding of how these things
work. Devices like the Makey Makey help to bridge the gap where people are
interested in computers and electronics but don&#39;t quite know how to get
started. Once they are more comfortable, they may progress onto more complicated
projects involving a Raspberry Pi or Arduino.</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">The introduction and use
of small computing devices affects my daily life in multiple ways. As I&rsquo;m
a person that enjoys tinkering with things to get them working, I have already
found multiple uses for these kinds of devices. I currently use Raspberry Pi
type devices for things including an ad-blocking DNS server, VPN Wi-Fi access
point and a home media server. I also use an Arduino powered 3-D printer and
have been toying with ideas for other Arduino projects. These small and
inexpensive devices remove many previously set barriers about what someone can
create and do with technology at home. I feel that this has a positive affect on
both myself and my family and friends around me as projects and ideas designed
for entertainment or to simply make life easier can now be realised with some
tinkering and determination.</span></p><p class="c3"><span

Ideas</span></h2><p class="c16 c32 subtitle" id="h.u6ddt325oa5p"><span
class="c10">Chris </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p
class="c42"><span class="c2">Our group had a variety of ideas for projects from
assessment one in Introduction to Information Technology.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">Jordan came up with a remote animal interaction
device to entertain a cat while the owner was not at home. While he has
expressed that he is not a &lsquo;cat person&rsquo;, it was a humorous read that
made what could have been a boring project, enjoyable.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">Suki went all out and provided a futuristic project
by means of a &lsquo;Carbon Dome&rsquo; capable of sustaining life on mars! He
mentions important aspects such as how the Dome will be powered and how CO2 will
be broken down.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">Chris aimed for a
sustainability inspired plant management system with remote monitoring
capability. He was attempting to implement solar power as the power source and
make amendments to the software on the fly.</span></p><p class="c26"><span
class="c2">Noting that this portion of the assignment emphasises problems that
need to be solved, we will come back to these ideas in just a
second.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">On a recent holiday, one of
our team members had the pleasure of undertaking a nocturnal wildlife tour of a
National Park in Kakadu. The tour guide was a passionate local who spoke
persuasively to the tourists about wildlife and environmental conservation.
While he had the audience captivated with his heavily rehearsed dialogue, he
would make reference to &lsquo;the great Sir David Attenborough&rsquo; and
attributed his knowledge of his ancestral land to excessive animal planet
documentaries he would watch. Throughout the tour he bought the tourists
attention to a cat he observed hunting a group of native birds in some long
grass on the riverbank. He proceeded to regurgitate animal planet facts about
feral and domesticated cats killing on average, about 75 animals per year. He
continued to mention that many of Australian native species can&rsquo;t
withstand these levels of predatorial domination and will become increasingly at
risk of extinction if the matter cannot be addressed.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">This news was saddening to hear and only one aspect
of a myriad of environmental statistics that may see our children not afforded
the same wildlife experiences that we take for granted today.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">This also got us thinking, the three ideas
mentioned above from assignment one was, Jordan with his cats, Suki with his
Dome&rsquo;s and Chris with his sustainability aspect. That&rsquo;s it, we have
our project.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">The pure and simple
solution that we have for this issue is a &lsquo;Remotely monitored and
self-sustainable, domesticated cat indoor habitat&rsquo;. This incorporating all
three of our ideas to reduce the impacts of cats hunting native animals outside
of the home.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">Ideas we have come up
with include creating a collar to track the cat&rsquo;s movements within the
home, heart rate and provide stimulus to the cat when needed. The household
&lsquo;dome&rsquo; could be managed by robotics or advanced software that would
be able to conduct minor tasks such as, cat monitoring and behavioural cue
identification, cleaning of any faecal matter, stimulating the cat when needed
and providing nutrients and water as required. On the sustainability front,
proper promotion and publicising of this project would incite interest amongst
cat owners around the world and in turn be adopted or implemented. The result of
the above points would have a positive impact on the general wellbeing of
domesticated cats and in turn a change to the predatorial impacts that cats have
on our native animals.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">By far this is
not a completely achievable project and it does require some technology
advancements, hardware creating and software building. This is our little crack
at tackling a larger problem with the various ideas that we as a group
originally came up with. It has been an enjoyable topic to address and write
about.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><h3 class="c1"

class="c16"><span class="c2">I feel like our chosen collaboration (Google Docs
and Github) and communication (Discord) technology mix worked fairly well for
our team, seeming it was our first time collaborating in this way.</span></p><p

id="h.d22204w8rs8x"><span class="c10">What could be improved?</span></p><p
class="c16"><span class="c2">For future assignments it will be important to
improve our organisation in regards to team meetings. Team meetings should be
arranged in advance and documented better so that there is no confusion about
when meeting will be held.</span></p><p class="c3"><span
class="c2"></span></p><p class="c16 c32 subtitle" id="h.m686dlxlc85h"><span
class="c10">What was surprising?</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2">I was
surprised that we lost a team member very early in the assignment. Our team name
was an acronym of our original team members last names, although we chose to
keep it the same after losing our sixth member.</span></p><p class="c3"><span

class="c10">What have I learned about groups?</span></p><p class="c16"><span
class="c2">I have learned that all people are different and may prefer to work
and communicate in different ways. Because of this, it is very important for the
group to try their best to accommodate everyone&#39;s preferred work and
learning styles.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p
class="c16 c32 subtitle" id="h.tsrfdnfbjbup"><span class="c10">How does the
Github log reflect the groups work?</span></p><p class="c16"><span
class="c2">For this assignment, the Github log doesn&rsquo;t necessarily reflect
on everyone&#39;s actual contribution to the groups work. This is because we are
using other collaboration technologies as well as Github. We are using Google
Docs for our report PDF so that everyone can see and contribute to the document
in real time, instead of using Github &lsquo;pull&rsquo; and &lsquo;push&rsquo;
requests to get the latest version of the report. Our group website is hosted on
Github pages, and any group member that has contributed to the website code will
be acknowledged in the Github log.</span></p><p class="c3"><span

class="c21"><span class="c6">I think our collaboration effort went well , with
the tools we chose like Discord and google docs. Discord helped us to have our
group meetings and Google Docs helped us organise our Canvas documentation. And
we used the Github repo updating And tracking our edits as specified in the
assignment and to create our website.</span></p><p class="c21 c25"><span

the groups work</span></p><p class="c21 c25"><span class="c6"></span></p><p
class="c21"><span class="c6">I dont think that the GitHub log activity will
reflect very well on the groups activity as some of our members were still
learning how to use Git, but the rest of the members were happy to step in and

class="c8"><span class="c6">I feel like all the tasks were assigned without any
issues from the very start and our use of google docs helped us keep track of
everyone&#39;s submissions under one cohesive document. I would also like to
mention Chris and Jordan for their quick thinking on how everything should be
arranged and delegated, especially the timeline document created by Jordan
helped us keep track of what part of the assignment should be finished by which
date. </span></p><p class="c8 c25"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c47 c32

improved?</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c6">There were some minor
communication errors from the start, but as time passed, I feel like it it got
much better but there is still room for improvement. </span></p><p class="c8

id="h.53r16v46k7fa"><span class="c20 c9">At least one thing that was
surprising?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c6">From the very start, almost
everyone in our group was very resourceful and respectful of one another and
were very responsible for their respective assigned tasks. The fact that there
were no misunderstandings between the group members was refreshingly surprising.
</span></p><p class="c8 c25"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c47 c32

class="c6">Communication is the most important element so there are no
misunderstandings, I believe that our group communicated very well but there is
room for improvement. </span></p><p class="c8 c25"><span
class="c6"></span></p><p class="c47 c32 subtitle" id="h.kxo1h9hxo8ag"><span
class="c20 c9">How well the GitHub log reflects the activity of the groups
work.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c9">I would say GitHub log reflects
poorly on our group activity as it does not take into account the work done on
our group Google document. </span></p><p class="c3"><span

class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><h4 class="c39 c32"
id="h.u8kofzhrx6kf"><span class="c19">Chris</span></h4><p class="c16"><span
class="c2">What went well? I think as a group we assigned tasks effectively and
everyone was willing to put their hand up and accept responsibility for
completing them. We planned for meetings, gave it our best to make them and if
anyone was unable to attend, they would let the group know prior to the
commencement of the meeting. The team made their intentions clear from the
beginning by signing a group charter that sets out the standards we planned to
abide by for our fellow members.</span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c2">What
could have been improved? The group was slow to initiate the assessment
planning. There was initial contact with members but the first meeting and
decisions on the collaboration tools were delayed. Once the group arranged and
conducted a meeting on Discord, there was some confusion and communication
issues using voice chat. The issues included, people speaking at the same time,
people not speaking at all and personal IT issues. Another improvement would be
the group meeting its timeline goals to ensure we stick to the plan and have
enough time to finalise the assignment.</span></p><p class="c26"><span
class="c2">One surprising thing was that we lost a team member in the early
stages and had to manage the workload with five members.</span></p><p
class="c26"><span class="c2">One thing I have learned about groups is to break
the ice and get the team together for an initial meeting.</span></p><p
class="c16"><span class="c2">How well does GitHub track our group activity? I
don&rsquo;t think it tracks it well at all. GitHub is only one aspect of the
assignment and is the online repository of all of our work. As a team, we
utilised Google docs, Canvas, Discord and GitHub. We have multiple documents
that members have contributed to with online discussions in Canvas and on
Discord that is not tracked in GitHub. I think GitHub accurately tracks the
contributions of the members uploading the data to the site. To mitigate this
issue, we tried running a GitHub demo for some of our less experienced members
and this helped spread the load on the more experienced members. </span></p><p
